For laneimages.cpp run:
g++ `pkg-config --libs opencv` laneimages.cpp -o laneimages
./laneimages original.bmp

You can use any picture for the original image, and in the laneimages.cpp file
There are some commented imwrite() functions you can uncomment to see the 
image proccessing steps

Probably will look into a more roubust alcorithim in the future
